# Sorting Algorithm Test Suite

This project provides a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the performance of various sorting algorithms implemented in C. The following sorting algorithms are tested:

- **Selection Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a clear and consistent way to evaluate and compare the performance of different sorting algorithms. Each sorting algorithm is tested under identical conditions, and key metrics such as execution time, number of comparisons, and number of swaps are recorded.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the test suite, you'll need:

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Make (optional, for convenience)
